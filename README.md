# FastAPI Person Management

This code provides a simple FastAPI application for managing person data.

## Functions

- `add_person`: This function handles the addition of a new person to the data list. It expects a JSON payload with the person's name, occupation, and address. If all fields are present, the person is added to the data list, and a success message is returned. If any of the fields are missing, an error message is returned.
- `get_person`: This function retrieves the list of all persons currently stored in the data list.

## Purpose
The code is written to demonstrate how to use FastAPI for managing a simple person database. It showcases the usage of POST and GET methods for adding and retrieving person data. This code can be used as a starting point for building more complex APIs for person management.

## Favorite Pokemon
My favorite Pokemon is Zoroark because I once played a fan game called Pokemon : Brick Bronze which allowed that when you caught a shiny zoroark it would allow you to turn 
into the shiny version of any pokemon you turned into.
